A Minecraft clone made with Rust + WGPU.

This project is both a learning experience to learn 3D graphics,
and something I have been wanting to create for a while.
In my opinion, Minecraft is not very easy to mod and add complex 
user generated content, and so I have always wanted to create my 
own clone of it, with better support for modding and loading/unloading
mods on-the-fly, as well as downloading the mods necessary to play on
a server automatically.

The project is currently undergoing reconstruction as the previous 
engine I had built for it was not performant enough and would lag
due to synchronization issues between multiple threads.
