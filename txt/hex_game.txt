A game made in Unity that I made during high school to learn about hexagonal grids. 
The idea was to make a hexagonal chess, though I took a lot of creative liberty with 
the ways the pieces can move, and so it became Hex Game instead of Hex Chess.

You can play the game in your browser against an AI. 
There is even a 'How to Play' section that shows the possible moves for any given piece.
