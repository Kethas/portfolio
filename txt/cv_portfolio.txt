My CV and this portfolio which accompanies it were both made with the Rust framework Yew, 
which makes a static webpage with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and compiles the Rust code into WASM.
Even though I wanted to avoid using JavaScript, for web this isn't very realistic.
Passing closures from Rust to JavaScript is not very trivial and involves creating
memory leaks on purpose. Instead I just added a script tag to the index.html files.
This was mainly for IntersectionObservers, DOM events and the like.

I made these webpages both as an exercise in frontend developement as well as a place to 
showcase my skills and projects, both for potential employers (CV), and for my peers and
any others who might be interested in what I do.

The source code of both these pages is available at the links below, and my CV can be viewed
in the browser via the link.
