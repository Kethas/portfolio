Originally, this was supposed to be a typing game for a 
high school Computer Science class assignment, 
kind of like a text-based 'Typing of the Dead', 
however I pivoted towards a choose-your-own-adventure text game.

While the content is not complete, the engine made in HTML, CSS, 
and (mostly) JavaScript is complete, and the entire adventure is 
a JS object containing all of the dialogue and choices.
