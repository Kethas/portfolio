A parser made in Rust that focuses on usability rather than speed.
Unlike many LL or LR parsers, Psi doesn't compute a lookup table for its rules, but instead a tree structure.
Technically speaking, Psi is an LL parser, though with a certain trick, left-recursion can be enabled.

The thought behind the 'usability' factor of Psi is that there is 
a Rust macro exposed to create a parser Rule tree (grammar).
